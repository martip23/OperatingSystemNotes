A makefile has been provided to make compiling easy and to make sure
this program is run exactly as they are intended to on my end.
This program has been tested and works on the TX State Zeus server.

HOW TO BUILD:
1) Open terminal in this directory
2) Type $make all
	(This will compile all files)
3) Run files using $./[filename]

File names {lab2, pre, sort}

When running pre & sort type ./

I worked very hard on this program. I got most functions working correctly. Input redirection and output redirection work correctly. Pipe only works for in/out redirection. 

input.dat and out.dat have been provided for testing.
